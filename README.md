# 🔆 Solar Energy Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Objective
This project aims to predict solar energy generation using machine learning regression models. It analyzes environmental factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation to forecast energy output.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Power BI (dashboard creation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Model Evaluation: R² Score, MAE, RMSE
- Power BI Dashboard for visualization and trend monitoring

## 📊 Visuals
(Add screenshots of Power BI dashboards or model results here)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab
4. Run all cells to view results and visualizations

## ✅ Results
- XGBoost achieved the best performance with an R² score of 0.92
- Interactive Power BI dashboards provide insights into energy generation patterns

## 🧠 Use Case
Can help solar plant managers, utility companies, and data engineers improve energy planning and output forecasting.
